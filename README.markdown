Animated background
===================

The GNOME desktop has the ability to change your desktop background by reading an XML definition.

And example of this is /usr/share/backgrounds/cosmos/background-1.xml.


This project is my first Scala XML experience, so don't expect anything mayor.
There are already multiple tools that do this, but as I'm testing out Scala, this seemed like a good project to try.
