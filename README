Tool to create animatable background for gnome (with transitions)
using the background-xml values.


see /usr/share/backgrounds/cosmos/background-1.xml
and desktop/background in gconf

There are already multiple tools that do this, but as I'm testing out Scala, this seemed like a good project to try.
